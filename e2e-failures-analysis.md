## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Wait Conditions**

The primary issue appears to be missing `waitForLoadState("networkidle")` calls before interacting with elements, similar to what we fixed in the auth tests. From the test report:

- Most tests timeout at 30s, indicating they're waiting for elements that never appear
- Tests are trying to interact with elements before the page is fully loaded

### 2. **Selector Issues**

Some tests may be using selectors that aren't stable across different browsers or need more specific targeting:

- Profile edit tests show elements are present but not interactable
- Dashboard shows correct structure but tests can't find elements

### 3. **Browser-Specific Timing**

WebKit has the most failures (31), suggesting it may need longer wait times or different strategies:

- WebKit seems to have more navigation and display issues
- Firefox and Chromium have similar failure patterns

### 4. **Common Error Patterns**

From examining the test report:

- **Timeout waiting for elements**: Most common error across all tests
- **Element not found**: Suggests selectors or navigation issues
- **30s timeout**: Default Playwright timeout being hit consistently

### 5. **Specific Issues by Test Type**

- **Dashboard tests**: Quick actions links exist but tests can't interact with them
- **Profile tests**: Form elements present but timing issues with edit mode
- **Team tests**: Navigation and form submission timing problems
- **Membership tests**: Page structure exists but element interaction fails

## Fix Plan

### Phase 1: Add Wait Conditions (Priority: High)

1. Add `waitForLoadState("networkidle")` after page navigations
2. Add explicit waits before form interactions
3. Update all test files systematically

### Phase 2: Fix Common Patterns (Priority: High)

1. **Dashboard Tests**: Fix quick actions and navigation tests
2. **Profile Tests**: Fix form interaction timing
3. **Team Tests**: Fix data loading and form submission timing

### Phase 3: Browser-Specific Fixes (Priority: Medium)

1. Add browser-specific wait times if needed
2. Update selectors that might be browser-dependent
3. Test WebKit-specific failures individually

### Phase 4: Test Isolation (Priority: Medium)

1. Ensure tests don't share state
2. Add proper cleanup between tests
3. Consider test data isolation strategies

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create a helper function for common waits

```typescript
export async function waitForPageReady(page: Page) {
  await page.waitForLoadState("networkidle");
  // Additional stability checks if needed
}
```

### Step 2: Update test files systematically

1. Start with authentication tests (already partially done)
2. Move to dashboard tests
3. Continue with profile, teams, and membership tests

### Step 3: Run tests individually by category

```bash
# Test each category separately to identify specific issues
pnpm playwright test dashboard.auth.spec.ts
pnpm playwright test profile-edit.auth.spec.ts
# etc.
```

### Step 4: Add debug logging

- Add screenshots on failure
- Log navigation events
- Track timing issues

### Step 5: Optimize for parallel execution

- Ensure unique test data
- Add proper test isolation
- Consider using test fixtures for common setup

## Specific Test Failures Analysis

### Dashboard Tests

From the page snapshot, the dashboard structure is correct:

- "Quick Actions" section exists with "View Profile" and "Get Membership" links
- Navigation sidebar is present with all expected links
- The issue is likely timing - tests try to click before React has attached event handlers

### Common Fix Pattern

Based on successful auth test fixes:

```typescript
// Before (failing)
await page.goto("/dashboard");
await page.getByRole("link", { name: "View Profile" }).click();

// After (should work)
await page.goto("/dashboard");
await page.waitForLoadState("networkidle");
await page.getByRole("link", { name: "View Profile" }).click();
```

## Next Actions

1. Start with fixing the dashboard tests as they affect all browsers
2. Apply the same wait patterns that fixed the auth tests
3. Run tests in headed mode to observe failures
4. Create reusable test utilities for common patterns
5. Focus on the most common pattern: adding `waitForLoadState("networkidle")` after navigation
