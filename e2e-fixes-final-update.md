# E2E Test Fixes - Final Update

## Latest Changes Made

### 1. Updated Auth Helper Timeouts

**File**: `e2e/utils/auth.ts`

- Increased all timeouts from 5s to 10s for better stability
- Changed `waitForLoadState('networkidle')` to `waitForLoadState('domcontentloaded')`
- Added wait for "Logging in..." button to confirm form submission
- Increased navigation timeout from 15s to 30s
- Increased page ready delay from 500ms to 1000ms

### 2. Fixed Unauthenticated Auth Flow Tests

**File**: `e2e/tests/unauthenticated/auth-flow.unauth.spec.ts`

- Updated to use `clearAuthState` helper
- Replaced manual login with `uiLogin` helper
- Added proper waits for form fields to be ready
- Fixed redirect test to properly verify redirect parameter

## Current Test Status

Based on the error snapshots analyzed:

- **Pattern**: Tests are getting stuck on login page with "Logging in..." button disabled
- **Root Cause**: Login succeeds (API returns 200) but navigation takes longer than expected
- **Solution**: Increased timeouts should allow navigation to complete

## Key Findings from Playwright MCP

1. Login form submission works correctly
2. API authentication succeeds (200 OK response)
3. Navigation eventually completes but takes ~3-5 seconds
4. Redirect parameter is properly read and used

## Expected Results

With the increased timeouts:

- Login flow should complete successfully
- Tests should reach their intended pages
- Failing test count should drop significantly

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor the current test run** - The increased timeouts should resolve most failures
2. **If issues persist**:
   - Check server logs for slow response times
   - Consider adding retry logic for navigation
   - Investigate why navigation takes so long

3. **For remaining failures**:
   - They will likely be test-specific issues
   - Not related to the systemic login problem
   - Each can be addressed individually

## Test Run Progress

The current test run should complete with significantly fewer failures. The main systemic issues have been addressed:

- ✅ Login redirect parameter fixed
- ✅ Auth helper timeouts increased
- ✅ Test data reset to clean state
- ✅ Proper test isolation implemented
