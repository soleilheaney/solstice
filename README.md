## Sports Registration Platform

Solstice is a **modern web platform for managing memberships, teams, and events**. Built with [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start) and deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ or v20+)
- pnpm (v9+)
- PostgreSQL database

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/solstice

# Application
VITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# OAuth Providers (optional)
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
```

## Project Structure

- `src/routes/` - File-based routing (pages and API endpoints)
- `src/lib/auth/` - Better Auth configuration and functions
- `src/lib/db/` - Drizzle database setup and schemas
- `src/lib/server/` - Server-side database schemas
- `src/components/ui/` - shadcn/ui components

## Development

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Set up the database:

   ```bash
   pnpm db push
   ```

3. Generate auth schemas:

   ```bash
   pnpm auth:generate
   ```

4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

## Available Scripts

- `pnpm dev` - Start development server
- `pnpm build` - Build for production

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflows handle:

- **Continuous Integration**: Linting, type checking, and testing on Node.js 18 and 20
- **Deploy Previews**: Automatic Netlify preview deployments for pull requests
- **Code Coverage**: Test coverage reports uploaded to Codecov
