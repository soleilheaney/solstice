# Sports Registration Platform

This is a web application built with [SST](https://sst.dev/) and [TanStack](https://tanstack.com/), deployed on AWS.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- AWS CLI
- AWS SSO credentials

## AWS Configuration

This project uses AWS SSO for authentication. Make sure you have the AWS CLI installed and configured.

### SSO Login

1. Configure SSO:
   ```
   aws configure sso
   ```

2. Log in with SSO for development:

   ```
   aws sso login --profile soleil-dev
   ```

## Running the Project

When running `npx sst dev`, pay attention to AWS credentials. The project looks for credentials in this order:

1. Environment variables
2. SST config
3. AWS config
4. Credential files

To avoid credential issues when running locally, you can explicitly set the profile:

```
AWS_PROFILE=soleil-dev npx sst dev
```

This ensures the right AWS profile is used, overriding any other profile that might be set in your environment variables.

## Project Structure

- `/sports-reg-platform` - The main application code
  - Built with TanStack Router and React
  - Uses Prisma for database access
  - Styled with Tailwind CSS

## Development

2. Run the development server:

   ```

3. In another terminal, start the frontend:
   ```
   cd sports-reg-platform
   npm run dev
   ```
