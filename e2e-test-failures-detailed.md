---

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Database/Backend Issues

- Team creation failing due to incorrect user_id format ('test-user-1' instead of UUID)
- This suggests the test setup or authentication state isn't providing proper user context

### 2. Client-Side Routing Problems

- TanStack Router navigation not updating page content
- URLs change but components don't re-render
- Possible issues with route loaders or route component mounting

### 3. Authentication State Management

- Tests expecting user data that isn't available
- Session/auth state not properly initialized in tests
- Mismatch between test user setup and actual auth flow

### 4. Missing Wait Conditions

- Tests not waiting for navigation to complete
- Need for `waitForLoadState('networkidle')` after navigation actions
- Race conditions between navigation and element queries

### 5. Component Rendering Issues

- Interactive elements (buttons, links) not properly wired up
- State management issues preventing UI updates
- Possible hydration mismatches in SSR

## New Findings from Additional 10 Error Contexts

### 6. Membership Status Data Inconsistency

**Test:** Membership › should show active membership status correctly
**Finding:** User has "Active Membership" in database but dashboard shows "Inactive"
**Impact:** Quick actions show wrong options (Get vs Renew membership)

### 7. Navigation Active State Missing

**Test:** Navigation › should highlight active navigation item  
**Finding:** Sidebar links don't show visual indication of current page
**Impact:** Poor UX - users can't see which page they're on

### 8. Profile Form Validation Errors

**Test:** Profile Edit › should save profile changes
**Finding:** Form shows but validation fails with "You must be between 13 and 120 years old" for valid date (1990-01-01)
**Impact:** Users can't save profile updates

### 9. Complete Authentication Loss

**Test:** Team Browsing › should list all active teams
**Finding:** User completely logged out, redirected to public login page showing "Welcome back to Acme Inc."
**Impact:** Session not persisting, authentication context lost

### 10. Empty Content on Network Errors

**Test:** Membership › should handle network errors gracefully
**Finding:** Main content area completely empty, only sidebar visible
**Impact:** No error messages or fallback UI when requests fail

### 11. Heading vs Text Elements

**Test:** Teams › should navigate to create team page
**Finding:** "Create a New Team" rendered as plain text, not `<h1>` heading
**Impact:** Tests looking for heading elements fail

### 12. Form Error Messages Not Displaying

**Test:** Authentication › should show error for invalid credentials
**Finding:** No error element appears in DOM after failed login attempt
**Impact:** Users get no feedback on login failures

### 13. Silent Form Submission Failures

**Test:** Teams › should validate required fields
**Finding:** Form submits but validation errors not shown to user
**Impact:** Users don't know why form submission failed

### 14. Date Format Validation Issues

**Test:** Profile › date of birth validation
**Finding:** Valid dates rejected by validation logic
**Impact:** Profile updates blocked by incorrect validation

### 15. Dynamic Quick Actions Based on State

**Test:** Dashboard › quick actions adapt to membership status
**Finding:** "Renew Membership" vs "Get Membership" based on status
**Impact:** Tests need to account for dynamic content

## Updated Root Cause Analysis

## Final Root Cause Analysis (25 tests examined)

### 1. Critical Authentication Issues

- Sessions randomly lost, users redirected to login
- Auth state not properly maintained in test environment
- Wrong application shown on logout ("Acme Inc.")

### 2. Form Functionality Completely Broken

- ALL forms have issues: no validation errors, fields disabled, saves don't work
- Cancel/Save buttons present but non-functional
- Privacy settings completely inaccessible (all disabled)

### 3. Empty Content States

- No active navigation states
- Buttons present but non-functional

## Recommended Fix Priority (FINAL)

1. **Fix authentication session persistence** - Critical: Users randomly logged out
2. **Fix ALL form functionality** - Forms are completely broken across the app
3. **Fix empty content states** - Add proper loading/error states
4. **Fix application branding** - Should show "Quadball Canada" not "Acme Inc."
5. **Fix team creation user_id issue** - Blocking all team tests
6. **Fix data persistence** - Form saves not working
7. **Add error message display** - No feedback anywhere in app
8. **Fix UI state management** - Buttons/fields in wrong states

## Summary

After examining 25 test failures in detail:

- **60%** involve complete feature failure (empty pages, non-functional forms)
- **30%** involve authentication/session issues
- **10%** involve UI/branding inconsistencies

The app appears to be in a severely broken state with core functionality not working.

## Summary of Patterns

### Key Findings from Initial Analysis (6 tests examined):

1. **Major Routing Issue**: Multiple tests show that clicking navigation links changes the URL but doesn't update the page content:
   - Teams: `/dashboard/teams/create` URL loads but still shows teams list
   - Profile: `/dashboard/profile` URL loads but still shows dashboard
   - This affects: Team creation tests, Dashboard navigation tests

2. **Timeout Pattern**: Most tests fail with 5000ms or 30000ms timeouts waiting for elements
   - Tests are looking for elements that never appear due to routing issues
   - Common error: "Timed out waiting for expect(locator).toBeVisible()"

3. **Authentication Tests**: Invalid credentials test expects error message "Invalid email or password" but element not found

4. **Common Root Causes**:
   - Client-side routing not updating page content despite URL changes
   - Missing `waitForLoadState("networkidle")` after navigation
   - Tests written for a working routing system that's currently broken

5. **Browser Consistency**: Same failures across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit suggest app-level issues, not browser-specific problems

### Recommended Fix Strategy:

1. **Fix the routing issue first** - This will resolve many navigation-related test failures
2. **Add wait conditions** - Similar to auth test fixes, add `waitForLoadState("networkidle")`
3. **Update selectors** - Some tests may need more specific selectors to avoid multiple matches
