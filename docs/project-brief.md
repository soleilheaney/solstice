## Project Brief: Quadball Canada Registration and Events Website

### Project Overview

Quadball Canada needs a comprehensive, easy-to-use platform for managing event registrations, player memberships, team profiles, and administrative tasks. This platform should simplify processes for players, teams, and admins, with customizable features and streamlined management.

### User Roles and Privileges

- **Event Coordinators**: Admin privileges limited strictly to their specific event(s), such as editing rosters, managing payment statuses, and sending reminders.

#### Team Logins

- View and manage team members, assign coaches and team leads.
- Purchase memberships for players individually or allow players to register/pay independently.
- View player history, event participation, and edit jersey numbers.
- Generate custom reports limited to their own team members.
