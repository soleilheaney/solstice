EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Hitachi Data Systems and Interdynamix System are pleased to respond to Worker’s Compensation Board Storage Subsystem Replacement RFP #1209BB. Both organizations believe a company’s information is a strategic asset. That’s why we continue to develop and improve storage solutions with the performance, availability, and scalability you need to maximize ROI and minimize risk. We always consider your perspective and business needs while applying the best hardware, software, and services to satisfy
your requirements. Our commitment to being a partner beyond technology sets us apart from other vendors in the industry. It means we’re prepared to help you envision your future and create an open and collaborative storage management framework, policy-based automation tools, virtualization capabilities, and the world’s finest storage systems.

Difficult economic times require new perspectives and strategies for reducing the cost of storage infrastructure. The past several years of IT procurement have left many IT organizations with underutilized and oversubscribed storage capacity. Now, with a squeeze on capital and credit, many organizations are faced with edicts to do more with less and to make tough decisions on where to invest available funds. In particular, there are increased demands to do more with the existing, sunk
infrastructure costs in the IT department. We are presenting WCB with a solution to meet the current requirements; however we also have other proven solutions which also focus on reducing the TCA (Total Cost of Acquisition) and TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) by leveraging our framework to achieve an economically superior way of deploying and growing our storage.

The key highlights of our response are as follows:

TCO: We believe we will save WCB costs by selecting our solution. As part of this bid, we’d like to talk to WCB about our storage economics, a series of proven methodologies, tools, solutions and planning practices that enable the application of financial and economic principles to storage technologies to help our customers with the TCO of storage, which would allow us to validate our details. Based on our initial assessment, our calculations indicate that we could easily save WCB costs. This
is taking into consideration key factors such as Performance, Floor Space Efficiency, Power/Cooling Efficiency, Capacity Improvements, etc.

Price Does Not Equal Cost: The total cost of acquisition (TCA) for storage is roughly only 20% of TCO. Over time, the TCA will become less and less significant. Labor, maintenance, power and cooling currently drive a higher cost (some 3 to 4 times higher) than acquisition alone. The measurable economic impact on TCO with thin provisioned, tiered and virtualized storage architectures can be dramatic. Our solution incorporates all of the items with TCO in mind. (see “Storage Economics Overview”
Reference Document)

Initial Investment: HDS executive management and Interdynamix see WCB as a Key Strategic account. We would like to add WCB to our growing list of extremely happy and satisfied customers. We have leveraged funds to deliver a onetime initial purchase discount in the range of over $200,000 off list price. Although we have applied a onetime aggressive discount for this RFP, we would be more than happy to also include extremely aggressive pricing going forward.

Technology: HDS has proven, reliable, and award winning technology with key focus on scalability, migration, and dynamic provisioning. It’s not all about purchasing new IT. There are technologies that can help you get maximum value from your previous storage investments. They reduce the need for your future investment to grow at the same rate that your data grows.
We call these economically superior storage architectures, and their key ingredients include:
• Storage virtualization
• Thin provisioning
• Dynamically tiered storage
• Common storage management
• Capacity efficiency
• Efficient migration
• Integrated archive

All technologies that we can deliver will directly affect your TCO!

Our Proposed Solution:
Based on your defined requirements and information we’ve gathered in conversation from your teams previously we are proud to offer the Hitachi Adaptable Modular Storage 2300 platform. This is a highly available solution that will provide a reliable and cost-effective tier 2 platform for WCB while delivering all the performance and reliability you would expect from a tier 1 solution. We have configured this AMS 2300 to include 50 TB of usable capacity built with 600 GB SAS drives operating at
15,000 RPM in a RAID 6 (6 data + 2 parity drives) for the best in performance and reliability for the workloads you anticipate. The AMS 2300 is the middle model in this family and can easily be upgraded to the AMS 2500 in place without disruption. We have also configured it with a quantity of 16, 8 Gbps Fibre Channel ports. We would envision this to be implemented connected to your IBM SVC via the existing IBM 348N Director. We have included the minimal require software to manage the platform
and perform In System Replication using our volume cloning software (ShadowImage) and point in time copy software (Copy-On-Write) to provide you with the security of in-system data protection. We feel that based on what we know and the requirements defined, we have configured and presented the best possible solution for WCB.

MIDRANGE STORAGE SUBSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

DS4800 Disk Subsystem that serves disk space to our Open Systems environment. The disk capacity currently residing on the IBM DS8300 Disk Subsystem (Tier I) are not in scope for this RFP.
WCB is looking for the best configuration of disk types that may or may not include SATA, Fibre-Channel, SAS, and/or SSD in order to achieve the best possible performance for the data types (as described in Section 3.1.2.2 Tier III Storage) stored on this subsystem.
The WCB requests new hardware of the most current generation generally available.
Vendors are requested to provide a summary overview justifying how their equipment proposal fits within the WCB. Referencing Industry Standards is strongly encouraged.
All pricing for the following requirements are to be provided in Section 7 – Price Response: Midrange Storage Subsystem.
The Vendor’s proposed storage subsystem configurations will be evaluated as per Section 4.2 – Evaluation Process. The equipment items for response are listed under four headings:
6.1 Critical Requirements
6.2 Highly Desirable Requirements
6.3 Desirable Requirements
6.4 Other Requirements and Information Requests

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

The  requirements  and  specifications  listed  in this section are considered critical to procuring a Midrange Storage Subsystem replacement solution.   
All items included in this section Must be part of the proposed solution. 
WCB  reserves  the  right  to  disqualify  a  Vendor’s  proposal  if  in  its  sole  discretion  response item(s) does not provide sufficient information to justify or confirm a listed requirement(s).
Proposals are to include, but not be limited to, the requirements described under this section.

Formatted Disk Capacity

Storage sizes are expressed as 1 GB is 1,073,741,824 bytes and 1 TB is 1,099,511,627,776 bytes. Formatted Disk Capacity refers to the disk capacity seen by the operating system on the host(s).
Open Systems Mid Tier storage capacity estimates at WCB have been calculated for a five (5) year period through 2016. Yearly estimates are based on 20% growth on the formatted capacity, and are represented in ‘Table 5 Five Year Capacity Projection’ shown below.

\*Note: The TB amount for 2012 is the same as current as the WCB does not expect to expand capacity in the first year.

6.1.1.1 Recommended Formatted Disk Capacity
Recommend three (3) options for sufficient disk capacity acquisitions needed to satisfy the growth estimates in Table 5 Five Year Capacity Projection for the following scenario options:

Option 1: The first year of capacity requirements (2012),
Option 2: For years 2012 and 2013 together, and
Option 3: For years 2012, 2013, and 2014.

It is critical that the proposed solution is capable of supporting the capacities identified in Table 5 using technology available at the time of proposal and without requiring any upgrades to the subsystem except the additional disk and enclosures required for the additional capacity. Pricing for the three options is requested in Section 7.6 – Total Solution Cost Pricing Sheets.
Interdynamix and Hitachi Data System are proposing a single AMS2300 that will have sufficient capacity to meet the requirements for the 5 year grow requirements as described above.
6.1.1.2  Describe and Justify Formatted Disk Capacity Configuration
Describe and justify that the Proposed disk configuration is the best mix of optimal performance and configuration flexibility at the time of proposal. This configuration should not put any barriers to expanding the disk over the total five years, and should allow for expansion without any reduction in performance.
Identify and justify proposed disk attributes, including but not restricted to:

Type of disk;
RPM;
Disk cache size;
Connection Speeds;

Connection types;
Total data storage capacity per disk type; and
Disk drive capacity.

We have configured the AMS 2300 system to accommodate the desired WCB capacity requirements. As requested, there are three options presented. Option 1, option 2, option 3 will provide WCB the configuration and pricing for a year one, year two and year three capacities respectively.  
Please note that capacity upgrades can be added at anytime, non-disruptively without requiring an outage by your HDS certified CS&S engineer.
It should be noted that by implementing the AMS 2300 in stand-alone mode (not virtualized behind SVC) would allow WCB to leverage our Hitachi Dynamic Provisioning technology and actually use less physical capacity for year 1 and add capacity as it is actually consumed by the hosts attached. HDP allows for creation of large pools of RAID groups to be partitioned and allocated to hosts. The hosts consume the capacity as needed and better utilization is driven as a result. New RAID Groups can be
added to the pools as necessary and HDP Volumes grown as necessary.
Data is rebalanced across the pool as RGs are added providing better performance (more spindles = more IOPS) and unused capacity can be returned to the pool to be used elsewhere by use of our Zero Page Reclaim function.

Option One Capacity - 2012:
The capacity details for option one are are as follows:

Disk Type: 600 GB SAS 15k RPM Drives
Number of Disks: 136
Raid Sets: Qty 17 RAID 6 (6 data + 2 parity) Sets
Raw Storage Capacity (TB): 75.94
Usable Storage Capacity (Base 10) TB: 56.96
Usable Storage Capacity (Base 2) TB: 51.8

This option clearly meets WCB’s year one requirement.

Option Two Capacity- 2012, 2013:
The capacity details for option one are are as follows:

Disk Type: 600 GB SAS 15k RPM Drives
Number of Disks: 168
Raid Sets: Qty 21 RAID 6 (6 data + 2 parity) sets
Raw Storage Capacity (TB): 94.35
Usable Storage Capacity (Base 10) TB: 70.76
Usable Storage Capacity (Base 2) TB: 64.36

This option clearly meets WCB’s year one and two requirement.

Option Three Capacity- 2012, 2013, 2014:
The capacity details for option one are are as follows:

Disk Type: 600 GB SAS 15k RPM Drives
Number of Disks: 200
Raid Sets: Qty 25 RAID 6 (6 data + 2 parity) sets
Raw Storage Capacity (TB): 112.76
Usable Storage Capacity (Base 10) TB: 84.57
Usable Storage Capacity (Base 2) TB: 76.92

This option clearly meets WCB’s year one, two and three requirement.

Connection Details
Connection configuration to the array consists of (Qty) 16 - 8 Gbps FCP ports which are aggregate to the active/active controllers.

The connections from the controller through to the backend disk enclosures leverages a 3 GB/sec SAS backend as opposed to the more common FCAL (Fiber Channel Arbitrated Loop) technology found in most similar arrays.
The connection detail are the same for all three options.

Cache
The system is configured with 16 GB of cache which is optimized under this architecture to provide a larger portion of user cache that previous technologies.

The memory bandwidth between each DCTL processor and its local cache is 10.6GB/s (so 21.2GB/s aggregate). The AMS 2300 has one bank of cache (with two DIMM slots) per controller. We have configured this system with 16 GB of cache. There is a 6.4GB/s intercontroller communications bus between the DCTL processors for commands and communications, maintenance operations and duplexed (mirrored) cache operations.
The cache or all three options is the same.
RAID Arrays

Describe and justify the proposed RAID configuration to ensure against data loss. Explain the performance benefits of the proposed RAID configuration.
We have selected a 600 GB size drive to match capacity with performance characteristics. Naturally better performance could be driven if you were to leverage the Dyanmic Provisioning capability of the AMS, however to our knowledge HDP is not supported if it is virtualized behind IBM’s SVC.
The choice of RAID 6 was determined based on reliability aspects relative to RAID levels, RAID 6 providing the greatest protection of data against the unlikely event of a double disk failure while a RAID group is rebuilding. Inherently the system uses global hot sparing to protect and predict failure. The system uses these spare disk drives and reconfigures any drives that are blocked due to errors or drives whose error count exceeds a specified limit value using spare disks. (Drives
belonging to a Parity Group with no LDEVs defined are not reconfigured.) Since this processing is executed on the storage host in the background, this system can continue to accept I/O requests. The data saved on spare disks are copied into the original location after the error drives are replaced with new ones.
In the case of multiple drive failures in a RAID set, the following is accurate for all manufacturers and is a consequence of the RAID group used.
R5- 100% data loss.
R6 and R10- 0% data loss.
If a pool is comprised of R5 and a double drive failure occurs in the same raid group (which is very rare), all data in the pool is lost (i.e. 100% data loss and loss of the pool). No recovery is possible in this case. However, if a pool is comprised of R5 and a double drive failure occurs in the different raid groups, no data is lost in the pool (i.e. 0% data loss).
If a pool is comprised of R6/R10 and a double drive failure occurs in the same raid group (which is very rare), no data in the pool is lost (0% data loss).
From a reliability perspective, RAID 6 is obviously preferable over RAID 5
Subsystem Cache
Describe and justify how cache is implemented and configured for optimal performance, including but not restricted to the following information:
How is proposed cache sizing justified given the cache size availability on attached disk subsystem?
How is workload distributed across cache?
Describe recommended cache sizes for each increased disk capacity estimated in Table 5 Five Year Capacity Projection. Assume that workload increases at the same rate as disk capacity.
The connection bandwidth between each DCTL-H chip and its cache is 8GB/sec. The AMS 2300 has two banks of cache (2 DIMMs each) per controller, so total cache will either be 16GB (2GB DIMMs) or 32GB (4GB DIMMs). There is a 2GB/sec PCIe communications bus between the Controller processors for inter-controller communications, maintenance operations and duplexed (mirrored) cache write operations.
Hitachi is unique among modular storage vendors in offering mainframe-class cache partitioning to suit the performance needs of applications with a high degree of specificity. The illustration below shows a fixed 16KB cache segmentation scheme for competitive modular systems without cache partitioning. This design is inefficient for applications with small blocks (4KB) or large blocks (256KB) of data and is optimized only for applications that read and write data in 16KB blocks. Unfortunately,
the real world is not like this. The computer science literature on caching shows that many online applications process data in small blocks whereas decision support applications process data in much larger blocks.

Figure SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 1: Volume Security Without cache partitioning, 4KB and 128KB data is processed inefficiently in uniform 16KB cache segments.

The figure shows that Hitachi cache can be partitioned into Partition 1 with 4KB cache segments for applications reading and writing in small data blocks and into Partition 2 with 256K cache segments for applications reading and writing in large data blocks. In this way, the contents of the cache memory can be controlled more efficiently, resulting in performance that is orders of magnitude greater than the competition’s with the same amount of (or even more) cache memory.

Figure SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 2: With cache partitions, applications with small (4KB) and large (128KB) data blocks can be efficiently processed in cache.
Read-ahead Caching for High-performance Sequential Reads
Sequential read caching in the new midrange modular systems is enabled with built-in heuristics to read ahead for every I/O. The heuristics are applied to determine if the data is being accessed sequentially. If so, the Hitachi modular storage system “reads ahead” pages corresponding to that data.
Cache Residency Manager Feature Allows Data to Be “Locked and Unlocked” in Cache on the Fly
The Cache Residency Manager feature allows you to increase the speed of database applications by dynamically “locking” and “unlocking” frequently accessed data, such as database indexes, into cache in real time. Read and write functions are then performed at cache speeds, with no disk latency delay. The result is ultrahigh performance, with a 100 percent hit rate to the selected LUNs locked in cache, because they are accessed at memory speed rather than at disk I/O speed. With the Cache
Residency Manager feature, a portion of cache memory can be allocated to specific data. You can add, delete, or change data managed by the Cache Residency Manager feature at any time, quickly and easily.

Figure SEQ Figure \* ARABIC 3: Volume Security Port Option The Hitachi Cache Residency Manager feature can fix data in cache like a solid-state disk.
Cache Write Protection
Describe and justify Cache Write Protection that ensures data not committed to disk is retained in the event of a failure.
In the event of an unscheduled loss of power the system shuts down immediately. All unwritten data is held in the battery backed cache for up to 24 hours. Once power is restored a recovery procedure is performed and the data is destaged to disk completing any write pending operation. In cases where replication is being utilized between sites, this is completed across those links as well.

Hitachi AMS 2000 Series feature the following:
Mirrored cache—all writes are duplicated for data protection
Battery backup (minimum 48 hours, maximum four days for the AMS 2000 modular storage systems)
Optional integrated uninterruptible power supply (UPS) for ultimate protection
Data consistency checking in memory

Fiber Channel (FC) Connectivity
The proposed solution is to have Fibre Channel connectivity. Based on WCB provided capacity and performance data, describe and justify the proposed fibre channel port count, and connectivity speed, of the proposed Midrange Storage Subsystem in order to achieve improved performance results.
Describe the recommended port count increases (if any) for each of the years identified in Table 5 assuming workload increases at the same rate as disk capacity.

The proposed AMS 2300 has a quantity of 16 8 Gbps FCP ports. The following table describes the connection capability of the AMS 2000 Storage platform. Given your current and projected needs, you can see that the proposed solution will support a total of 128 hosts per port or 2048 host connections. From the information shared, we expect this will adequately support your requirements today and in the future.

VMWare Integration
Confirm that proposed solution is VMWare compatible including support for VAAI (vStorage API for Array Integration).
Describe any ‘End-to-End’ performance and monitoring tools that are included in this proposal.
Describe any Virtual Centre integration components that are included in the proposal.
The AMS 2300 we have proposed has complete support of the vStorage APIs for Array Integration (VAAI) which is all about the integration between vSphere 4.1 and supporting storage systems. This integration significantly improves virtual machine performance, density and availability to support, facilitate and accelerate VMware deployment. VAAI is a set of mechanisms that offload processing for certain data-related services (e.g., copy functions) to VAAI-supported storage systems.

The AMS 2300 includes our latest management toolset, HiCommand Suite which provides a vCenter Plugin for vSphere administrators to manage the storage infrastructure for deployment, vMotion, cloning virtual machines. This allows administrators to directly manage the underlying storage asset from the vCenter console providing for tight integration of physical and virtual infrastructure environments.

\*For additional information please refer to the attached document hds-simplying-vmware-storage-management.pdf in the appendix section.

Redundancy
Confirm that the proposed solution has no single points of failure and describe how this is achieved.
The AMS 2300 has been designed as a completely redundant and highly available solution, by design it offers no single point of failure. All components are hot swappable and microcode updates can be performed non-disruptively. Hot swappable components include the following:

Controllers
Disks
Power Supplies
Cache
Fans
Batteries
Disk Enclosures

The Active-Active Symmetric system allows for a host I/O present on any front-end port to be processed by either controller. All LUNs are associated with one of the two controllers by the LUN Management Table. If a host request for a LUN arrives on a port on the current managing controller, then that is called “Direct Mode”. If that request is for a LUN managed by the other controller, that is known as “Cross Mode”. In Cross Mode, the local Intel processor directly sends the request to the
Intel CPU on the other controller for execution over the inter-DCTL communications bus.

There are 32 back end 3Gb/sec disk paths controlled by the four SAS engines and up to 480 SAS or SATA disks in 32 disk enclosures (RKAK) of 15 disks each. These enclosures accept either 3Gb/sec SAS disks or 3Gb/sec SATA-II disks. There are no disks in the controller module (RK) on this model. The first RKAK enclosure must have at least four disks of the same type, while any additional RKAK enclosures must have at least two disks each. As all disks are mutli-pathed on the back-end there are no
single points of failure within the shelves.
IBM SVC Compatibility Confirmation

Vendors Must provide a design of the proposed solution and confirm via hard copy print that the proposed hardware is compatible with WCB’s SVC. The link to IBM’s SVC compatibility list with third party hardware Vendors is:
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ssg1S1003697
HDS confirms that the proposed AMS2300 is on the IBM SVC culpability list. Please accept this statement in this proposal as a hard copy print that confirms this fact. Please refer to the above mentioned web page for further confirmation.

HIGHLY DESIRABLE REQUIREMENTS

The requirements and specifications listed in this section are labeled as highly desirable to procuring a Midrange Storage Subsystem replacement solution. The items listed in this section are not mandatory however they are considered essential in a new solution. Vendors will not be disqualified if all items in this section are not responded to, however items with no response or lack of information will receive a zero (0) score resulting in a lower overall score.
Vendors are asked to include, but not be limited to, the requirements described under this section.
System Availability

Confirm that the proposed solution can be available 24 x 7 (99.99%) and describe all required modifications, to meet this target.
The proposed system is designed as a highly available and completely redundant system with no single point of failure. All components are hot-swappable including micro-code upgrades. Availability is subject to not only the system itself but the environment it operates within and the users who manage it. With that said, providing WCB ensures that consistent and reliable power is provided and all operators are competent and knowledgable, there is no reason that the proposed system cannot meet
your avalability requirements.

Drive performance is monitored by the system, errors are tracked and logged and disks are swapped out as part of the Correction Copy and Dynamic Sparing processes outlined before. Individual disk performance degradation is an indicator or possible failure and the system will not allow for risk. System Information Messages (SIM) are provided to the console and as part of the Hitachi Service this information is handled by our HiTrack service which is described in more detail in the next section
where we describe Maintenance and Support.

All these aspects come together to provide for a highly available and reliable storage platform.

Maintenance and Support

Propose maintenance and support agreements that clearly supports our Open Systems environment’s availability goals of 24 x 7 (99.99%).
We have included the Standard Hitachi Maintenance program with this proposal.
Hitachi Data Systems’ problem resolution system is multi-faceted and involves the following: the Global Call Centers(GCC), Global Support Centers (GSC) and local support technicians (CSS). HiTrack Call-Home is online 7x24 and immediately notifies the GCC and GSC of a hardware problem. The HiTrack RACC service provides for remote access by GSC personnel to query the problem, upload traces from the site, etc. Local CSS is dispatched for onsite support and component replacements as required. The
problem resolution process is outlined below as follows:
Respond to requests for service within the required time frame.
Notify the customer, in case of HiTrack call-home, that a component has failed and onsite service is being dispatched.
Assess the situation for Severity (levels one(1) through five (5).
If the failure is due to a simple component that requires replacement, the part is ordered and the customer is notified to open a change request. The part is then replaced as instructed within the designated time frame.
If the failure requires a more in-depth analysis, relevant data is collected and the Global Support Centre (GSC) is consulted until problem is resolved completely.
All customers that select the top tier 7x24 service as proposed in this response receive service response exceeding customer expectations. Hitachi Data Systems prides itself on its service organization and in customer service surveys; it is frequently rated as first.
The proposed solution includes our world famous support and service to provide WCB with a set it and forget it kind of relaiblility. In addition to a highly available and reliable platform, the system includes our call home service which is described in the following section. We can ensure a 99.999% availability of this system.
The Hitachi Data Systems call-home system is “Hi-Track” (RAID Hi-Track for Enterprise class subsystems). It is internet-based using “https” protocol over port 443 with outbound only transmission. It provides complete 7x24x365 monitoring of the subsystem(s). Its reports consist of a daily health check along with a weekly configuration update report that is transmitted once per week. The Hi-Track service is armed at all times to call home immediately if there is a System Error (SIM). Since it
initiates communication only from the SVP (Service Processor) of the system, if access to the IP address was improperly obtained, no customer data would be visible through connection to the SVP. Customer data can only be accessed via the FC ports through the customer’s Storage Area Network. The SVP’s purpose is limited to configuration, service and monitoring of the subsystem.
If further isolation of the subsystem is required from the Internet, a Hi-Track Relay program exists that allows customers to choose one of their Internet-facing servers to send the Hi-Track information. In this case, the SVP communicates only to this customer’s server thereby providing another layer of isolation for the subsystem.
There is optionally another advanced service available that is referred to as RACC (Remote Access Control Center). It is more complex to install as a customer server is chosen to act as the Site Manager for the site. Hi-Track Site Manager and the RACC service reside on this server and communicate with an agent on the Subsystem(s) SVP(s). This setup does, in an emergency and with the client’s permission, allow for a remote access connection to be established to the site using an F5 Secure VPN
tunnel to establish communication. There is no extra charge for this service and more information is available if desired. The advantage is the ease by which the customer can grant permission for a remote specialist to access the subsystem to collect “information dumps” or observe the error the SVP is reporting for the subsystem. This service has proven invaluable for many sites as it allows technical support personnel to query the situation in advance of the local service person’s onsite
arrival.

Battery Backup

Battery backup is highly desirable. Describe the proposed feature including, but not limited to, the data that is protected and the amount of time protected by the battery.
For the most part the proposed solution leverages a battery backed cache and destaging process to ensure that there is no risk of data loss. Key features of the AMS 2000 family cache are:

Mirrored cache—all writes are duplicated for data protection
Battery backup (minimum 48 hours, maximum four days for the AMS 2000 modular storage systems)
Optional integrated uninterruptible power supply (UPS) for ultimate protection
Data consistency checking in memory

Data is further protected by use of our two In System Replication technologies and the raliability that comes from RAID 6 as described in previous section. Further to the security of data by use of RAID and ISR, the manner in which we monitor and predictively swap out drives before they become a problem ensures that your data is always protected.

Designed to ensure the integrity of data, Hitachi modular storage systems allow users to specify global hot spares from among any of the modules in the storage system, for multiple levels of redundancy. In the highly unlikely event that a disk drive reaches an error threshold but is still able to transmit data correctly, the data on the failing disk is automatically copied to one of the global hot spares, with no need to rebuild data from the failed disk. If the disk drive fails before the copy
is produced and the user has defined the RAID group as either RAID-1 (mirrored), RAID-1+0 (mirrored and striped), RAID-5 (rotating-parity group) or RAID-6 (double parity group), a global hot spare is selected and the data is copied onto it. Data is copied from the surviving disk of the mirror (RAID-1 or RAID-1+0), or data is rebuilt from a parity (RAID-5) or double-parity group configuration.
This system keeps track of the number of errors that occurred, for each drive, when it executes normal read or write processing. If the number of errors occurring on a certain drive exceeds a predetermined value, this system considers that the drive is likely to cause unrecoverable errors and automatically copies data from that drive to a spare disk. This function is called dynamic sparing In RAID1 method; this system is same as RAID5 dynamic sparing. The AMS500 can have up to 16 spares and the
AMS100 can have up to 30 spares.

Correction Copy
When this system cannot read or write data from or to a drive due to an error occurring on that drive, it regenerates the original data for that drive using data from the other drives and the parity data, and copies it onto a spare disk. In RAID1 method, this system copies data from the drive to a spare disk.

Performance Criteria

Provide a Performance guarantee and explain what can be expected from the proposed solution including ESX Performance.
Highlight and make recommendations to potential bottlenecks or performance issues identified within the current WCB environment as it pertains to the proposed solution.
While performance gaurantees cannot be provided because of the simple fact that operator and environment variables beyond our control can affect outcomes what we can provide you with are validations of anticpated performance based on your specific configuraiton. We generate these using a variety of inhouse developed tools that are used when we create configurations for our customers who need to meet specific performance specifications.

Based on the configuration we have developed we expect the following performance profile based on a Read/Write mix of 70/30:

Sustained IOPS: 8,900
70% Peak IOPS: 12,500

What is more comforting than a gaurantee to most customers, is Hitachi Data Systems commitment to ensuring optimal performance of all solutions. That can be accomodated after the fact if performance needs change by upgrading controller models, addition of faster disk (SSD) or higher performing RAID groups (RAID 10), cache residency or adding ports. Regardless of the need, HDS and Interdynamix Systems Corp will be there to ensure you get the most from you investment for year to come. The
following table shows the Benchmark results from the Storage Performance Council.

DESIRABLE REQUIREMENTS

The requirements and specifications listed in this section are considered desirable to procuring a Midrange Storage Subsystem replacement solution. The items listed in this section are not mandatory however they are considered preferred in a new solution. Vendors will not be disqualified if all items in this section are not responded to, however items with no response or lack of information will receive a zero (0) score resulting in a lower overall score.
Vendors are asked to include, but not be limited to, the requirements described under this section.

Performance Monitoring

Describe and justify the performance monitoring tools.
The proposed solution includes a variety of options for performance monitoring available, we have provided only the basic performance monitoring tool aspects that are included within the HiCommand Suite management product.

The storage management suite (Hitachi Command Suite 7) includes Device Manager (configuration, provisioning, LUN create/expand/modify, thin provisioning management, capacity reporting etc.); Tuning Manager (application, host and array performance monitoring; thin provisioning capacity growth trending, performance alerting); Command Director, which allows for current and historical SLA measurements and SLA/SLO conformity, and historical capacity utilization monitoring.

Additionally, Hitachi Data Systems offers a wide range of performance monitoring and management tools for a variety of needs and uses. Some of these tools include the following:
Hitachi Storage Capacity Reporter
HSCR provides a full view of the SAN storage environment from the applications, hosts, and storage arrays from a historical perspective. Information is retained for extended periods of time (years) to help administrators track growth, usage and trending metrics. Automated mapping demonstrates the relationship between each host and LUN in an environment to depict how the storage resources are being used. Array utilization demonstrates the amount of allocated storage from each storage array.
Application utilization identifies the amount of storage used vs. that allocated by application. HSCR is a heterogeneous capacity reporting tool that does not use an agent to collect array-based or host-to-array based storage utilization metrics.
HSCR will identify the following:
Over-provisioned LUNs
Storage underutilization
Which hosts are consuming most of the storage resources
What data is stored on what type storage type and at what RAID level
Orphaned LUNs. Identifying orphaned LUNs enables the reclaiming of orphaned storage.
Out of the box reports include.

Data Migration Process

Describe the process to migrate data from the current storage subsystems to the proposed subsystems. Provide details including schedules on your data migration plans.

Dave - Add an IDX blurb if you want

Hitachi Data Systems provides world-class professional services through our Global Solution Services (GSS) organization. Data Migration can be provided to WCB on request using a variety of approaches. These consist of engagements where;
We do all the migration activities including project management
We provide just a technical oversight and work with your team
We provide project management.

A mix of these offerings is available and we can find a suitable match for WCB based on your schedules and preference. Migrations can be accomplished via host based or block based and we can bring in a variety of services and technologies under a GSS engagement to move data non-disruptively ensuring the greatest integrity in data is maintained and outages are kept to a minimum.

The difference in the host-based and frame-based versions of this service is primarily the migration techniques to be utilized:
Host-based: Migration techniques can be either host-based copy tools or system-based virtualization. Downtime is minimized with system-based virtualization because the systems remain in operation while the migration is under way.
Frame-based: Migration is based on host-based mirroring or replication by TrueCopy® software. All servers associated with the source storage system share a common outage window for the frame cutover to the target storage system.

During the planning and design phase, Hitachi Data Systems Global Solution Services (GSS) consultants assess the customer’s existing storage environment with the assistance of automated tool-based data collection and through interviews with the customer.
GSS consultants document the processes for migrating the data and recommend one or more migration approaches that would meet the customer’s requirements. The customer and Hitachi Data Systems decide together which approach to incorporate in the migration plan.

GSS consultants produce a formal Hitachi Array and Migration Implementation Plan that documents the implementation activities, incorporating the customer constraints and scheduling requirements.

The implementation phase includes basic functional testing to demonstrate the successful migration of the customer’s data to the target storage system. At the completion of the service, the customer’s servers will be fully operational from the customer’s target storage system.

This service provides data migration only. It does not include physical installation of the hardware components of the storage system. It is for local data migration at one site only and does not include tiered storage classification. Physical installation of the proposed solution is provided in advance by our Customer Support and Services (CS&S) organization.

Timeframes are dependent on the approach you choose and your outage or change window tolerances and thresholds. Suffice it to say, we do migrations all the time to our own technology and cross platform (I.e. from third party to third party).

Additional Administration Interfaces

Describe administration interfaces, how they are used, and accessed
The proposed solution includes the GUI based Hitachi HiCommand Suite management tool as well as CLI (Command-Line Interfaces) for a variety of service operations for scripted or automated operations so as replication activities, etc.

Storage Management: Hitachi Command Suite
Hitachi Command Suite features a unified architecture that integrates the products from the bottom up. Instead of separate products linked together, the software products in Hitachi Command Suite use a common code base, use the same graphical user interface and share a common look and feel. Configuration and storage tier information is combined and synchronized in a database accessed by multiple products, rather than on separate databases requiring larger data repositories that could be subject
to inconsistencies. The new design improves the efficiency and reliability of storage management information, and a consistent and more flexible user experience. The following Hitachi Command Suite products can benefit your Hitachi Adaptable Modular Storage system:

Hitachi Device Manager
Hitachi Device Manager provides centralized management of multiple Hitachi storage systems. Hitachi Device Manager features an improved graphical user interface, integrated workflows for improved usability and significant improvements to both scalability and performance. By providing a single console for managing complex storage environments, Hitachi Device Manager software unifies and simplifies storage management. With highly efficient context sensitive workflows, Device Manager supports
multiple management views, including physical, logical, host, NAS and virtual server for provisioning, and storage pooling for primary and secondary storage

Remote Mirroring Services

The WCB may at a future date create an offsite replication environment. Describe how your solution would accommodate an offsite replication environment and allow the use of a Disaster Recovery/Business Continuity secondary site for data replication if required. Identify required hardware/software.
The solution proposed is fully capably of replicating data between two or more data centers using a variety of methods. From simple failover to a remote site for DR by use of synchronous or asynchronous replication we can ensure that data remains consistent in both locations. Other options include Hitachi Dynamic Replicator which allows for consistent data accessibility across cascading data centers for business continuity.

Disk Driver/Firmware Software

Provide the disk driver/firmware software compatibility matrix levels, required by the proposed disk subsystem. Include a plan of high level steps required to migrate from WCB’s current disk drivers/firmware to the proposed drivers/firmware.
The proposed system does not intend to leverage existing HDDs so firmware migration will not be a part of the solution or migration process.

Additional Hardware or Software

The Vendor may state and justify the acquisition of additional hardware or software over and above the proposed solution that will improve performance, reduce future cost, or improve the life of the proposed solution.

As part of the proposal we would recommend that WCB considers leveraging the Hitachi Virtual Storage Platform as an alternative to the current IBM SVC. This world-class technology would extend the capability of not only this Tier 2 disk sub-system but additionally extend the life, capability and performance of all existing storage assets in use today. Including all IBM storage assets such as the SVC.

We would be happy to provide details and additional configurations to support part or all of your existing assets and welcome dialogue to discuss this option.

Disposing/Recycling Old Equipment

WCB desires assistance in disposing of the current storage subsystems. Propose a method to dispose/recycle current hardware (DS4800), in an environmentally prudent fashion.
Assign and describe any residual value of the current hardware (DS4800).
HDS follows the following method for equipment that will be disposal of (as opposed to traded-in):
The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal is the most comprehensive global environmental agreement on hazardous and other wastes. It has over 160 Parties and aims to protect human health and the environment against the adverse effects resulting from the generation, management, transboundary movements and disposal of hazardous and other wastes. The Basel Convention regulates the transboundary movements of hazardous and other wastes and
obliges its Parties to ensure that such wastes are managed and disposed of in an environmentally sound manner. The Convention covers toxic, poisonous, explosive, corrosive, flammable, ecotoxic and infectious wastes. Parties are also expected to minimize the quantities that are transported, to treat and dispose of wastes as close as possible to their place of generation and to prevent or minimize the generation of wastes at source. They deliver training and technology transfer for the
implementation of the Convention. The Basel Convention came into force in 1992. E-waste contains problematic substances such asead, cadmium, beryllium, mercury or brominated flame retardants for example which can harm human health and the environment if they are not refurbished, recycled, or disposed of in an environmentally sound manner.
● E-waste grows at a rate of 3-5% per annum, three times more rapidly than the general waste stream.
● More and more E-waste ends in landfills and incinerators where it releases hazardous materials into the environment.
● Large quantities of E-waste are exported to countries where, due to a lack of environmental regulations and infrastructure, recovery facility workers and neighbouring residents are exposed to health risks and the environment to pollution hazards.
Material will be processed domestically and no material will be exported to Non-Basel Signatory countries.
See the following brochure - http://www.basel.int/pub/leaflets/leaflet170806-1.pdf
This charge will ensure 100% landfill diversion and total destruction of all data storage devices. The only "unknown" is freight - if material is located on the loading dock there will be no charge, however if we have to remove it from the building we would require a site visit to determine this charge. The process is material is dismantled and segregated into various categories:
Precious Metal Bearing - Circuit Boards/Mother Boards/Connectors/etc.
Non- Ferrous Scrap - Aluminum/ Copper/Brass/etc
Ferrous - Steel
Hard drives are the 1st item to be removed and shredded immediately upon receipt. Resulting material recovered is then sent to the appropriate smelter or refiner for final processing back into raw material
<this was what was in the last HDS WCB proposal.. it can from HDS… not sure if it still applies.. you should check with HDS>
Residual Value for DS4800:
Unfortunately, there is little to no residual value in the DS4800. That being said, Interdynamix is willing to offer a one time $5000.00 trade-in promo for the return of this equipment. We will provide to WCB a $5,000 services credit on account when the DS4800 is returned.

< dave make sure you are comfortable with this section>
Training

WCB desires onsite or Vendor location training for the proposed solution. Provide proposed training details including potential dates for 2012.
Look at last WCB document- we have not really proposed anything We need to say something like… we propose a combination of WBT and on-site training and it will cost X The cost of the training will need to be in the pricing section.

Point-in-Time Copy Replication Services
Describe and justify the copy replication services for the proposed Midrange Storage Subsystem solution.
State compliance on ability to provide copy replication services to duplicate a volume to the same subsystem within two seconds.
Confirm that the proposed solution is capable of providing copy replication services licenses to meet the back up of 1 TB of source volumes for 2012.
Confirm that the proposed solution is FlashCopy Version 2 compliant and describe any conversion process if applicable.

Relative to the specific items, replication of a volume is relative to your intepretation of duplication of a volume. Using Copy-On-Write (PIT copy software) a snapshot can be taken and a volume accessed within 2 seconds.
The software included in the proposed solution can easily satisfy this requirement providing complete full volume clones and multiple point in time copies.

FlashCopy Version 2 is NOT supported on the AMS 2000, it is supported on both our Virtual Storage Platform and previous Universal Storage Platform V/VM products.

The following section describes in detail the replication products included in the proposal.

Our proposed solution includes our In-System replication bundle, which includes two products for data protection. Shadow Image which allows for full volume clones and Copy-On-Write which provides snapshot or PIT (point in time) copies.

Hitachi Data Systems has two replication products for mirroring and PIT copies, ShadowImage InSystem Replication and Copy-On-Write Snapshot software respectively. Additionally for remote mirroning we have included TrueCopy Synchronous. Below is detail regarding how all these products work. Additional details have been included as attachements in the Appendix.

Hitachi ShadowImage In-System Replication Software
By providing non-disruptive, high-speed data replication within any Hitachi storage system, Hitachi ShadowImage In-System Replication software enables immediate use of data in decision support, software testing and development, or backup operations.

An essential component of today’s prudent business continuity strategies and optimized IT operations is the ability to quickly replicate data for critical application processing, testing and development of new applications, zero-downtime recovery, and necessary backup operations. Since traditional data recovery processes can be labor-intensive and span several hours, businesses cannot afford to gamble with the threat of downtime. IT managers are challenged to ensure these replication-based
tasks, including routine application development and testing, are performed without affecting production data or causing business disruption.

The high-speed, non-disruptive local mirroring technology of Hitachi ShadowImage In-System Replication software rapidly creates multiple copies of mission-critical information within a AMS 2000 Subsystem. The high-speed, non-disruptive technology of Hitachi Copy-on-Write Snapshot software rapidly creates up to 32 point-in-time copies of any data volume within an AMS 2000 system, without impacting host service or performance levels.

ShadowImage software keeps data RAID-protected and fully recoverable—without affecting service or performance levels. Replicated data volumes can then be split from the host applications and used for system backups, application testing, and data mining applications while business continues to run at full capacity.

Hitachi Copy-On-Write Snapshot Software
An essential component of business continuity is the ability to replicate data quickly. Hitachi Copy-on-Write Snapshot software provides logical snapshot data replication within Hitachi USP storage systems for immediate use in decision support, software testing and development, data backup, or rapid recovery operations.

Traditional downtime recovery processes can be labor-intensive and span several hours. In a world of just-in-time delivery, global supply chains, around-the-clock customer demand, and competition that’s just a mouse click away, businesses cannot afford to gamble with the threat of planned or unplanned downtime. These tasks must be performed without impacting production data or causing business downtime. The high-speed, non-disruptive technology of Hitachi Copy-on-Write Snapshot software rapidly
creates up to 32 point-in-time copies of any data volume within a AMS 2000 system, without impacting host service or performance levels. Because snapshots store only the changed data blocks in the Copy-on-Write Snapshot storage pool, the volume of storage capacity required for each Copy-on-Write Snapshot copy is substantially smaller than the source volume. As a result, Copy-on-Write Snapshot software can provide significant savings over full cloning methods. The Copy-on-Write Snapshot copies
are fully read/write compatible with other hosts and can be used for rapid data restores, application testing and development, data mining and warehousing, or non-disruptive backup and maintenance procedures.

Please note that given WCB’s direction to continue with the use of IBM’s SVC technology, this requirement is redundundant.

Further to the solution proposed in this response, Hitachi Data Systems is a world leader in storage virtualization and data management. We would encourage WCB to explore the offerings in this category and consider it as an alternative to not only extending the capability of your existing storage assets, but to further enhance your existing capabilities by consolidating your storage.
Storage Consolidation Solution
Storage consolidation unifies storage management on a high performance system in order to more easily deploy, manage and scale storage to accommodate increasing capacity growth. Rather than managing disparate islands of storage, a single pool of storage resources supports diverse applications and systems.

Consolidating storage into a single centralized resource can bring about significant improvements in storage utilization. This can reduce the need to buy and manage additional storage systems. In a consolidated environment, investment in increased capacity becomes driven by the combined needs of many servers and applications, rather than the needs of individual servers that are running out of disk space. If the storage pool needs enlarging, extra capacity can be easily added.

With a single pool of storage, capacity can be allocated to any server as it is needed. If an application’s need for additional storage is permanent, additional physical storage can be added without the need to take critical applications offline. If the need is temporary, the additional storage can later be returned to the pool and used by other servers.

Consolidated storage management capabilities enable faster backups and shorter recovery time and recovery point objectives. Backups and restores are transparent to users. Reliable local and remote replication, failover features and simplified methods for quick disaster recovery protect critical systems and help facilitate corporate and governmental data compliance requirements. Security features include user authentication and role-based access controls.

The Hitachi Data Systems solution offers the unique ability to connect external, multivendor storage. This creates a single virtualized pool of capacity for administrators to centrally manage using Hitachi storage management software. Virtual Storage Platform supports a wide range of third party storage systems.

InterDynamix and HDS would be happy to review and discuss options available to you regarding our Virtual Storage Platform and provide comparisons to what you have today. Our goal is to bring you the greatest value by offering innovative approaches and technologies to help WCB better leverage their investment in storage and data management.
