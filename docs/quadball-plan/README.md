## Project Overview

The Quadball Canada platform will be built on top of the existing Solstice foundation, leveraging:

- **TanStack Start** for full-stack React with SSR
- **Better Auth** for authentication with email/OAuth
- **Drizzle ORM** with PostgreSQL
- **Netlify** for hosting with edge functions
- **Square** for payment processing

The platform will support:

1. Member registration and profiles
2. Team management and rosters
3. Event creation and registration
4. Payment processing with flexible pricing
5. Communications and notifications
6. Analytics and reporting
7. Social media integration

Each milestone builds upon the previous, ensuring the platform remains deployable and functional throughout development.
