### Critical Path (23 weeks)

`M0 â†’ M1 â†’ M2 â†’ M4 â†’ M5 â†’ M7 â†’ M8`

The critical path ensures core business functionality (membership â†’ payments â†’ events â†’ analytics) while allowing parallel development of team management and communications.

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Items & Mitigation

1. **Payment Integration Complexity**
   - Start Square integration early in M2
   - Comprehensive testing environment
   - Stripe as backup payment processor

2. **Event System Scope**
   - Break into MVP + enhancements
   - Use proven form libraries
   - Progressive feature rollout

3. **Performance at Scale**
   - Performance testing throughout development
   - Database query optimization
   - CDN implementation for assets

### Contingency Plans

- Simplify pricing rules if M5 delays launch
- Manual payment processing fallback
- Phased feature rollout to manage complexity

## Business Value

### Immediate Benefits

- **Streamlined Registration**: Reduce signup friction by 60%
- **Automated Payments**: Eliminate manual payment tracking
