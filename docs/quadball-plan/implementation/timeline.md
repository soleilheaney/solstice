**Mitigation**:

- Start integration early in M2
- Implement comprehensive testing
- Have Stripe as backup payment processor
  **Contingency**: Simplify to manual payment processing initially

#### 2. Event Registration Complexity

**Risk**: Custom forms, dynamic pricing, capacity management
**Mitigation**:

- Break into smaller deliverables
- Use existing form libraries
- Implement progressive enhancement
  **Contingency**: Launch with basic registration first

#### 3. Performance at Scale

**Risk**: Database queries, concurrent users, file uploads
**Mitigation**:

- Performance testing throughout development
- Database query optimization
- CDN for static assets
  **Contingency**: Implement caching layers, database scaling

#### 4. Data Migration from Existing Systems

**Risk**: Data loss, format incompatibility, downtime
**Mitigation**:

- Parallel testing environment
- Gradual migration approach
- Comprehensive backup strategy
  **Contingency**: Maintain old system during transition

### Low-Risk Items

- UI component development
- Basic CRUD operations
- Email delivery
- Static content management
