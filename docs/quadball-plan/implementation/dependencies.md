## Critical Path Analysis

### Primary Critical Path (19 weeks)

```
M0 → M1 → M2 → M4 → M5 → M7 → M8
1w   2w   3w   6w   3w   4w   4w = 23 weeks total
```

**Why Critical**: Each milestone in this path has dependencies that block subsequent work:

- M0: Infrastructure foundation required for all development
- M1: Data model and RBAC required for user management
- M2: Payment system required for event fees
- M4: Event system core to business model
- M5: Advanced payments needed for complex pricing
- M7: Analytics needed for business insights
- M8: Final polish required for launch

### Secondary Paths

```
M1 → M3 → M4  (9 weeks)
M2 → M6 → M7  (10 weeks)
```

These can run in parallel with the critical path but have merge points.

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Critical Path Risks

#### 1. M1 Database Schema Issues

**Risk**: Schema changes require complex migrations
**Mitigation**:

- Design schema carefully upfront
- Use database branching for testing
- Plan migration scripts early
  **Contingency**: Simplify schema, add complexity later

#### 2. M2 Payment Integration Delays

**Risk**: Square API complexity, webhook reliability
**Mitigation**:

- Start Square integration immediately after M1
- Implement comprehensive testing environment
- Have Stripe integration as backup
  **Contingency**: Manual payment processing for initial launch

#### 3. M4 Event System Complexity

**Risk**: Custom forms, dynamic pricing, bracket generation
**Mitigation**:

- Break into smaller deliverables
- Use proven libraries where possible
- Implement MVP first, enhance later
  **Contingency**: Launch with basic event registration

### Dependency Optimization

#### Parallel Development Opportunities

**During M1 (Week 2-3)**:

- Start M2 UI wireframes
- Begin Square API research
- Plan M3 database relationships

**During M2 (Week 4-6)**:

- Start M3 team management UI
- Begin M6 email service setup
- Plan M4 event schema

**During M4 (Week 11-16)**:

- Begin M6 notification system
- Start M5 pricing rules design
- Plan M7 analytics data model

#### Fast-Track Options

**If Ahead of Schedule**:

1. Merge M5 into M4 (combine payment features)
2. Start M7 analytics earlier using M4 data
3. Begin M8 optimization during M7

**If Behind Schedule**:

1. Defer M5 advanced features to post-launch
2. Simplify M6 to basic email only
3. Reduce M7 to essential metrics only
